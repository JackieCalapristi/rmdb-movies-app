# Movie App 
Movie app powered by the RMDB API. I made this primarily to learn more about react hooks.

Deployed using netlify âœ¨ feel free to:
- Search for some of your favorite movies
- Load more movies (note that the movies loaded is persisted even when you reload the page!)
- Click on a movie to see all the actors in it and some more meta-data about the movie
- Enjoy!
